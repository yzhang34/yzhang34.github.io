As a postdoc at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), my research expanded to include pioneering photoacoustic imaging techniques, enabling noninvasive and rapid imaging of hemodynamics in humans. In the realm of quantum imaging, I developed innovative techniques utilizing spatial and polarization entangled photon pairs, overcoming challenges such as poor signal-to-noise ratios and low resolvable pixel counts.

While high-resolution ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy has been demonstrated for slide-free histology, the imaging speed is insufficient, due to the low laser repetition rate and the limited depth of field. To address these challenges, we present parallel ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy (PUV-PAM) with simultaneous scanning of eight optical foci to acquire histology-like images of slide-free fresh specimens, improving the ultraviolet PAM imaging speed limited by low laser repetition rates. The PUV-PAM has achieved an imaging speed of 0.4 square millimeters per second (i.e., 4.2 minutes per square centimeter) at 1.3-micrometer resolution using a 50-kilohertz laser. In addition, we demonstrated the PUV-PAM with eight needle-shaped beams for an extended depth of field, allowing fast imaging of slide-free tissues with irregular surfaces. We believe that the PUV-PAM approach will enable rapid intraoperative photoacoustic histology and provide prospects for ultrafast optical-resolution PAM.","tags":["PAT","PAM"],"title":"Optical-resolution parallel ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy for slide-free histology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Tong","Yide Zhang","Lihong V.

The fluorescence lifetime is a valuable measurement because of the quantitative information that is imparts, which is largely independent of fluorophore concentration. These measurements are sought after because they reflect a variety of intracellular changes such as molecular interactions, metabolism, and cellular microenvironmental status. The collection of fluorescence decay times has been applied using many advanced analytical techniques including polarization imaging, super-resolution imaging, FRET measurements, and many more. Yet, there is complexity in the interpretation of lifetime data owing to heavy data processing requirements such as data fitting and reduction. Phasor plotting has been trending and emerging as a useful means to simplify fluorescence lifetime analyses. Phasor graphs originated by vectorizing frequency-domain lifetime data, and have been translated from time-domain data as well. As phasor analyses become routine for lifetime data interpretation, understanding how the phasor plot works, the limitations, and benefits thereof, is important for all of bioscience.","tags":["Fluorescence microscopy","Phasor plot","FLIM"],"title":"Editorial: Phasor analysis for fluorescence lifetime data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701648000,"objectID":"392ec7fbfe76ec8e197adc6bd706ae5d","permalink":"https://yzhang34.github.io/post/nature-pacter/","publishdate":"2023-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/nature-pacter/","section":"post","summary":"Single-laser-pulse photoacoustic tomography with a single-element ultrasonic transducer, equivalent to thousands of virtual detectors, allows for ultrafast (up to 1 kHz) volumetric imaging of hemodynamics in humans.","tags":["Blog"],"title":"Single-shot 3D photoacoustic tomography based on a single-element detector for ultrafast imaging of hemodynamics","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yide Zhang","Peng Hu","Lei Li","Rui Cao","Anjul Khadria","Konstantin Maslov","Xin Tong","Yushun Zeng","Laiming Jiang","Qifa Zhou","Lihong V.

Here, we present quantum microscopy by coincidence (QMC) with balanced pathlengths, which enables super-resolution imaging at the Heisenberg limit with substantially higher speeds and CNRs than existing wide-field quantum imaging methods. QMC benefits from a configuration with balanced pathlengths, where a pair of entangled photons traversing symmetric paths with balanced optical pathlengths in two arms behave like a single photon with half the wavelength, leading to a two-fold resolution improvement. Concurrently, QMC resists stray light up to 155 times stronger than classical signals. The low intensity and entanglement features of biphotons in QMC promise nondestructive bioimaging.

The Bell nonlocality and quantum steering have been proposed to describe nonclassical correlations against local-hidden-variable and local-hidden-state theories, respectively. To characterize the two types of nonclassical correlations, various nonlocality and steering inequalities have been established, and the amount of inequality violation serves as a helpful indicator for many entanglement-based tasks. Quantum state tomography has been employed for measuring quantum states, while the method requires intensive computation and does not directly verify either nonlocality or steering over the full domain independent of established theories. Here, we experimentally map the full-domain correlation with bipartite states for nonlocality and quantum steering in Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt scenarios. The measurement of the maps automatically accounts for detection imperfections. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of the correlation maps in the entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol with arbitrary bipartite states. The correlation maps show direct measurements and simple interpretations that can answer fundamental questions about nonlocality and quantum steering as well as contribute to quantum information applications in a straightforward manner.","tags":["Quantum","Bell's test","Entanglement"],"title":"Experimental full-domain mapping of quantum correlation in Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yogeshwar Nath Mishra","Peng Wang","Florian J.

The state-of-the-art high-speed imaging techniques, developed to study non-repeatable turbulent flames, are limited to million-frames-per-second imaging rates, falling short in capturing the dynamics of critical species. Unfortunately, these techniques do not provide a complete picture of flame-laser interactions, important for understanding soot formation. Furthermore, thermal effects induced by multiple consecutive pulses modify the optical properties of soot nanoparticles, thus making single-pulse imaging essential. Here, we report single-shot laser-sheet compressed ultrafast photography (LS-CUP) for billion-frames-per-second planar imaging of flame-laser dynamics. We observed laser-induced incandescence, elastic light scattering, and fluorescence of soot precursors - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in real-time using a single nanosecond laser pulse. The spatiotemporal maps of the PAHs emission, soot temperature, primary nanoparticle size, soot aggregate size, and the number of monomers, present strong experimental evidence in support of the theory and modeling of soot inception and growth mechanism in flames. LS-CUP represents a generic and indispensable tool that combines a portfolio of ultrafast combustion diagnostic techniques, covering the entire lifecycle of soot nanoparticles, for probing extremely short-lived (picoseconds to nanoseconds) species in the spatiotemporal domain in non-repeatable turbulent environments. Finally, LS-CUP’s unparalleled capability of ultrafast wide-field temperature imaging in real-time is envisioned to unravel mysteries in modern physics such as hot plasma, sonoluminescence, and nuclear fusion.","tags":["CUP","Ultrafast imaging"],"title":"Single-pulse real-time billion-frames-per-second planar imaging of ultrafast nanoparticle-laser dynamics and temperature in flames","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yide Zhang","Binglin Shen","Tong Wu","Jerry Zhao","Joseph C.

The shaping system’s speed, the energy gain of the corrected wavefronts and the control degrees of freedom are the most important metrics for WFS, especially for highly scattering and dynamic samples. Despite recent advances, current methods suffer from trade-offs that limit satisfactory performance to only one or two of these metrics. Here we report a WFS technique that simultaneously achieves high speed, high energy gain and high control degrees of freedom. By combining photorefractive crystal-based analogue optical phase conjugation and stimulated emission light amplification, our technique achieves an energy gain approaching unity; that is, more than three orders of magnitude larger than conventional analogue optical phase conjugation. The response time of ~10 μs with about 106 control modes corresponds to an average mode time of about 0.01 ns per mode, which is more than 50 times quicker than some of the fastest WFS systems so far. We anticipate that this technique will be instrumental in overcoming the optical diffusion limit in photonics and translate WFS techniques to real-world applications.","tags":["Wavefront shaping","High-speed imaging"],"title":"High-gain and high-speed wavefront shaping through scattering media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Li Lin","Xin Tong","Susana Cavallero","Yide Zhang","Shuai Na","Rui Cao","Tzung K Hsiai","Lihong V.

We validate the technique with gold-standard haematoxylin-and-eosin histology images acquired via a traditional optical microscope, and also show that an unsupervised generative adversarial network can virtually stain the ultraviolet-photoacoustic-microscopy images, allowing pathologists to readily identify cancerous features.

Currently, PAT has two major implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) and photoacoustic microscopy (PAM). PACT uses a multi-element ultrasonic array for parallel detection, which is relatively complex and expensive. In contrast, PAM requires point-by-point scanning with a single-element detector, which has a limited imaging throughput. The trade-off between the system cost and throughput demands a new imaging method. To this end, we have developed photoacoustic topography through an ergodic relay (PATER). PATER can capture a wide-field image with only a single-element ultrasonic detector upon a single laser shot. This protocol describes the detailed procedures for PATER system construction, including component selection, equipment setup and system alignment. A step-by-step guide for in vivo imaging of a mouse brain is provided as an example application. Data acquisition, image reconstruction and troubleshooting procedures are also elaborated. It takes ~130 min to carry out this protocol, including ~60 min for both calibration and snapshot wide-field data acquisition using a laser with a 2-kHz pulse repetition rate. PATER offers low-cost snapshot wide-field imaging of fast dynamics, such as visualizing blood pulse wave propagation and tracking melanoma tumor cell circulation in mice in vivo. We envision that PATER will have wide biomedical applications and anticipate that the compact size of the setup will allow it to be further developed as a wearable device to monitor human vital signs.","tags":["PAT","PAM","PACT"],"title":"Snapshot photoacoustic topography through an ergodic relay of optical absorption in vivo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Varun Mannam","Yide Zhang","Xiaotong Yuan","Takashi Hato","Pierre C.

However, due to the diffraction limit, sub-micron/nanometer features are difficult to resolve. While various super-resolution techniques are developed to achieve nanometer-scale resolution, they often either require expensive optical setup or specialized fluorophores. In recent years, deep learning has shown potentials to reduce the technical barrier and obtain super-resolution from diffraction-limited images. For accurate results, conventional deep learning techniques require thousands of images as a training dataset. Obtaining large datasets from biological samples is not often feasible due to photobleaching of fluorophores, phototoxicity, and dynamic processes occurring within the organism. Therefore, achieving deep learning-based super-resolution using small datasets is challenging. We address this limitation with a new convolutional neural network based approach that is successfully trained with small datasets and achieves super-resolution images. We captured 750 images in total from 15 different field-of-views as the training dataset to demonstrate the technique. In each FOV, a single target image is generated using the super-resolution radial fluctuation method. As expected, this small dataset failed to produce a usable model using traditional super-resolution architecture. However, using the new approach, a network can be trained to achieve super-resolution images from this small dataset. This deep learning model can be applied to other biomedical imaging modalities such as MRI and X-ray imaging, where obtaining large training datasets is challenging.","tags":["Deep learning","Convolutional neural network","Super-resolution"],"title":"Deep learning-based super-resolution fluorescence microscopy on small datasets","type":"unused"},{"authors":["Xiaotong Yuan","Varun Mannam","Yide Zhang","Scott Howard"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\r\r\r\rClick the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.\r\r\rSupplementary notes can be added here, including [code and math](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/). --\r","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"bb00e33ce8d1372a4f73a5ad9f494ef8","permalink":"https://yzhang34.github.io/unused/unused-publication/c17-2021-pw1/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/unused/unused-publication/c17-2021-pw1/","section":"unused","summary":"We propose and demonstrate the first analytical model of the spatial resolution of frequency-domain (FD) fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) that explains how it is fundamentally different with the common resolution limit of the conventional fluorescence microscopy.

In the case of two-photon excitation fluorescence (2PEF) microscopy, two photons excite a fluorophore, which in turn emits a single higher-energy photon. The rate of 2PEF depends quadratically on the excitation intensity, thus enabling the axial localization of excitation in the vicinity of the focal plane. The 2PEF generally uses near-infrared (NIR) excitation, which experiences less scattering in tissue than shorter-wavelength light and does not cause background autofluorescence. A comparison between single-photon and 2PEF can be seen in the figure below, where 2PEF has a much higher localization capability. Therefore, out-of-focus fluorescence is avoided, and the overall photobleaching and phototoxicity in thick samples are reduced. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is also a powerful tool in biological, chemical, and medical studies: it provides an additional contrast, the fluorescence decay lifetime of excited fluorophores, in fluorescence microscopy. FLIM can be employed to image local calcium or potassium ion concentrations, dissolved oxygen concentrations, pH, refractive index, or the occurrence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. For example, the figure below shows how fluorescence lifetime changes following dissolved oxygen concentration in the microenvironment: the lifetime in an oxygen rich environment is obviously shorter than the lifetime in an oxygen deprived environment; hence by measuring fluorescence lifetime, one can extract dissolved oxygen concentration in the microenvironment after a calibration. Compared with conventional intensity-based microscopy techniques, FLIM has the advantage of significantly reduced sensitivity to errors caused by non-uniform optical absorption, scattering, photobleaching, and fluctuations in fluorophore concentration. Super-sensitivity MPM-FLIM We present a series of experiments that demonstrate a super-sensitive chemical imaging technique based on multiphoton frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (MPM-FD-FLIM) that shows a 2x improvement in imaging speed compared to the theoretical limit of conventional MPM-FD-FLIM. Additionally, this technique produces unprecedented sensitivity over a large range of fluorescence lifetimes. These results are achieved through simple modifications to data analysis in a conventional MPM-FD-FLIM microscope and are based on an analytical model describing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an MPM-FD-FLIM system [J.

Saturation-compensated FLIM Fluorophore saturation is the key factor limiting the speed and excitation range of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). For example, fluorophore saturation causes incorrect lifetime measurements when using conventional frequency-domain FLIM at high excitation powers. We present an analytical theoretical description of this error and present a method for compensating for this error in order to extract correct lifetime measurements in the limit of fluorophore saturation. We perform a series of simulations and experiments to validate our methods. The simulations and experiments show a 13.2× and a 2.6 × increase in excitation range, respectively. The presented method is based on algorithms that can be easily applied to existing FLIM setups. Related publications  Yide Zhang, Genevieve D. Vigil, Lina Cao, Aamir A.

Super-resolution microscopy: stepwise optical saturation (SOS) Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is an important tool in biomedical research for its ability to discern features smaller than the diffraction limit. However, due to its difficult implementation and high cost, the super-resolution microscopy is not feasible in many applications. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a saturation-based super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique that can be easily implemented and requires neither additional hardware nor complex post-processing. The method is based on the principle of stepwise optical saturation (SOS), where M steps of raw fluorescence images are linearly combined to generate an image with a $\\sqrt{M}$-fold increase in resolution compared with conventional diffraction-limited images. For example, linearly combining (scaling and subtracting) two images obtained at regular powers extends the resolution by a factor of 1.4 beyond the diffraction limit. The resolution improvement in SOS microscopy is theoretically infinite but practically is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio. We perform simulations and experimentally demonstrate super-resolution microscopy with both one-photon (confocal) and multiphoton excitation fluorescence. We show that with the multiphoton modality, the SOS microscopy can provide super-resolution imaging deep in scattering samples. Related publications  Yide Zhang, Prakash D. Nallathamby, Genevieve D.

Super-resolution FLIM: generalized stepwise optical saturation (GSOS) We present a novel super-resolution fluorescence lifetime microscopy technique called generalized stepwise optical saturation (GSOS) that generalizes and extends the concept of the recently demonstrated stepwise optical saturation (SOS) super-resolution microscopy [Biomed. Opt. Express 9, 1613 (2018)]. The theoretical basis of GSOS is developed based on exploring the dynamics of a two-level fluorophore model and using perturbation theory. We show that although both SOS and GSOS utilize the linear combination of M raw images to increase the imaging resolution by a factor of √ M, SOS is a special and the simplest case of GSOS. The super-resolution capability is demonstrated with theoretical analysis and numerical simulations for GSOS with sinusoidal and pulse-train modulations. Using GSOS with pulse-train modulation, super-resolution and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) images can be obtained simultaneously. The super-resolution FLIM capability is experimentally demonstrated with a cell sample on a custom-built two-photon frequency-domain (FD) FLIM system based on radio frequency analog signal processing. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of super-resolution imaging in FD-FLIM. Related publications  Yide Zhang, David Benirschke, Ola Abdalsalam, and Scott S.

Super-resolution microscopy: deconvolution stepwise optical saturation (DeSOS) Super-resolution microscopy is broadening our in-depth understanding of cellular structure. However, super-resolution approaches are limited, for numerous reasons, from utilization in longer-term intravital imaging. We devised a combinatorial imaging technique that combines deconvolution with stepwise optical saturation microscopy (DeSOS) to circumvent this issue and image cells in their native physiological environment. Other than a traditional confocal or two-photon microscope, this approach requires no additional hardware. Here, we provide an open-access application to obtain DeSOS images from conventional microscope images obtained at low excitation powers. We show that DeSOS can be used in time-lapse imaging to generate super-resolution movies in zebrafish. DeSOS was also validated in live mice. These movies uncover that actin structures dynamically remodel to produce a single pioneer axon in a “top-down” scaffolding event. Further, we identify an F-actin population – stable base clusters – that orchestrate that scaffolding event. We then identify that activation of Rac1 in pioneer axons destabilizes stable base clusters and disrupts pioneer axon formation. The ease of acquisition and processing with this approach provides a universal technique for biologists to answer questions in living animals. Related publications  Yide Zhang, Evan L.

Fluorescence Microscopy Denoising (FMD) dataset and deep learning denoising methods Fluorescence microscopy has enabled a dramatic development in modern biology. Due to its inherently weak signal, fluorescence microscopy is not only much noisier than photography, but also presented with Poisson-Gaussian noise where Poisson noise, or shot noise, is the dominating noise source, instead of Gaussian noise that dominates in photography. To get clean fluorescence microscopy images, it is highly desirable to have effective denoising algorithms and datasets that are specifically designed to denoise fluorescence microscopy images.

Phase-multiplexing FLIM and phasor plots We propose and demonstrate a novel multiphoton frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (MPM-FD-FLIM) system that is able to generate 3D lifetime images in deep scattering tissues. The imaging speed of FD-FLIM is improved using phase multiplexing, where the fluorescence signal is split and mixed with the reference signal from the laser in a multiplexing manner. The system allows for easy generation of phasor plots, which not only address multi-exponential decay problems but also clearly represent the dynamics of the fluorophores being investigated. Lastly, a sensorless adaptive optics setup is used for FLIM imaging in deep scattering tissues. The capability of the system is demonstrated in fixed and living animal models, including mice and zebrafish. Related publications  Yide Zhang, Ian H. Guldner, Evan L.

Automatic segmentation of FLIM images Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) provides additional contrast for fluorophores with overlapping emission spectra. The phasor approach to FLIM greatly reduces the complexity of FLIM analysis and enables a useful image segmentation technique by selecting adjacent phasor points and labeling their corresponding pixels with different colors. This phasor labeling process, however, is empirical and could lead to biased results. In this Letter, we present a novel and unbiased approach to automate the phasor labeling process using an unsupervised machine learning technique, i.e., K-means clustering. In addition, we provide an open-source, user-friendly program that enables users to easily employ the proposed approach. We demonstrate successful image segmentation on 2D and 3D FLIM images of fixed cells and living animals acquired with two different FLIM systems.

Resolution enhancement of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques have enabled dramatic development in modern biology due to their capability to discern features smaller than the diffraction limit of light. Recently, super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF), an analytical approach that is capable of generating super-resolution images easily without the need for specialized hardware or photoswitchable fluorophores, has been presented. While SRRF has only been demonstrated on fluorescence microscopes, in principle, this method can be used to generate super-resolution images on any imaging platforms with intrinsic radial symmetric point spread functions. In this work, we show that SRRF can be utilized to enhance the resolution and quality of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. By including an image registration algorithm to correct for sample drift, the SRRF-TEM approach substantially enhances the resolution of TEM images of three different samples acquired with a commercial TEM system. We quantify the resolution improvement in SRRF-TEM and evaluate how SRRF parameters affect the resolution and quality of SRRF-TEM results.

Due to its inherently weak signal, fluorescence microscopy is not only much noisier than photography, but also presented with Poisson-Gaussian noise where Poisson noise, or shot noise, is the dominating noise source. To get clean fluorescence microscopy images, it is highly desirable to have effective denoising algorithms and datasets that are specifically designed to denoise fluorescence microscopy images. While such algorithms exist, no such datasets are available. In this paper, we fill this gap by constructing a dataset - the Fluorescence Microscopy Denoising (FMD) dataset - that is dedicated to Poisson-Gaussian denoising. The dataset consists of 12,000 real fluorescence microscopy images obtained with commercial confocal, two-photon, and wide-field microscopes and representative biological samples such as cells, zebrafish, and mouse brain tissues. We use image averaging to effectively obtain ground truth images and 60,000 noisy images with different noise levels. We use this dataset to benchmark 10 representative denoising algorithms and find that deep learning methods have the best performance. To our knowledge, this is the first real microscopy image dataset for Poisson-Gaussian denoising purposes and it could be an important tool for high-quality, real-time denoising applications in biomedical research.","tags":["Denoising","Machine learning","Deep learning"],"title":"A Poisson-Gaussian denoising dataset with real fluorescence microscopy images","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"2d5f2d2a51481ab8c376a7ee293d5291","permalink":"https://yzhang34.github.io/project/denoising-fluorescence/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/denoising-fluorescence/","section":"project","summary":"A Poisson-Gaussian denoising dataset with real fluorescence microscopy images","tags":["Github Repository"],"title":"Fluorescence Microscopy Denoising (FMD) dataset","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"b4f400c7da1a22a74178398a5481fc94","permalink":"https://yzhang34.github.io/project/desos/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/desos/","section":"project","summary":"Generating intravital super-resolution movies with conventional microscopy reveals actin dynamics that construct pioneer axons","tags":["Github Repository"],"title":"Deconvolution stepwise optical saturation (DeSOS) microscopy","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yide Zhang","Evan L.

However, super-resolution approaches are limited, for numerous reasons, from utilization in longer-term intravital imaging. We devised a combinatorial imaging technique that combines deconvolution with stepwise optical saturation microscopy (DeSOS) to circumvent this issue and image cells in their native physiological environment. Other than a traditional confocal or two-photon microscope, this approach requires no additional hardware. Here, we provide an open-access application to obtain DeSOS images from conventional microscope images obtained at low excitation powers. We show that DeSOS can be used in time-lapse imaging to generate super-resolution movies in zebrafish. DeSOS was also validated in live mice. These movies uncover that actin structures dynamically remodel to produce a single pioneer axon in a ‘top-down’ scaffolding event. Further, we identify an F-actin population – stable base clusters – that orchestrate that scaffolding event. We then identify that activation of Rac1 in pioneer axons destabilizes stable base clusters and disrupts pioneer axon formation. The ease of acquisition and processing with this approach provides a universal technique for biologists to answer questions in living animals.","tags":["Saturation","Super-resolution"],"title":"Generating intravital super-resolution movies with conventional microscopy reveals actin dynamics that construct pioneer axons","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic \rAcademic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click \rPDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions? \rAsk\n\rDocumentation\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549324800,"objectID":"a3f58e0eeb54da210ef5225fcc839fbf","permalink":"https://yzhang34.github.io/unused/slides/example/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/unused/slides/example/","section":"unused","summary":"An introduction to using Academic's Slides feature.","tags":[],"title":"Slides","type":"unused"},{"authors":["Yide Zhang","Ian H.

However, conventional fluorescence microscopes cannot satisfy these needs due to physical limits on resolution, speed, information, and depth. In this work, we aim to overcome these limits using novel super-resolution microscopy and high-speed quantitative imaging techniques, both combined with multiphoton microscopy. First, we propose a super-resolution microscopy technique, termed stepwise optical saturation (SOS), to overcome the resolution limit. This technique is based on the principle of SOS, where M steps of raw fluorescence images are linearly combined to generate an image with a √M-fold increase in resolution compared with conventional diffraction-limited images. For example, linearly combining (scaling and subtracting) two images obtained at regular powers extends the resolution by a factor of 1.4 beyond the diffraction limit. The resolution improvement in SOS microscopy is theoretically infinite but practically is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio. The method can be implemented easily and requires neither additional hardware nor complex post-processing. Second, we propose a high-speed quantitative microscopy technique, termed phase multiplexing (PM) fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), to overcome the speed limit and obtain additional information. For each conventionally obtained scanning microscopy image, four PM images from four radio-frequency mixers are obtained simultaneously, whose linear combinations result in the intensity and lifetime (the fluorescence decay lifetime of excited fluorophores, providing additional information such as pH, ion concentration etc. about the microenvironment in biology) images of the sample. Because of the multiplexing, this technique is fundamentally faster than most state-of-the-art FLIM methods. With PM-FLIM, a typically slow and time-consuming fluorescence lifetime imaging process can become as fast as a conventional intensity imaging measurement. Finally, both techniques can be combined with multiphoton microscopy to overcome the depth limit of conventional fluorescence microscopes.","tags":["MPM","FLIM","Saturation","Super-resolution"],"title":"Super-resolution and high-speed quantitative multiphoton microscopy","type":"unused"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522540800,"objectID":"fcce3bc2653145985d753d18c8209a59","permalink":"https://yzhang34.github.io/project/two-step-sos-sim/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/two-step-sos-sim/","section":"project","summary":"Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy by stepwise optical saturation","tags":["Github Repository"],"title":"Stepwise optical saturation (SOS) microscopy","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yide Zhang","David Benirschke","Scott S.

We propose the multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (MPM-FLIM) platform with super-sensitivity and super-resolution capabilities to quantitatively obtain this information at the intracellular level. First, we present a simple MPM oxygen imaging probe compatible with aqueous biological media based on water-soluble ruthenium-complex nanomicelle. By adding a layer of silica shell to the nanomicelle assembly, oxygen sensitivity and probe stability in biological media increases dramatically. Second, we implement the super-sensitivity lifetime imaging by nonlinear optical mixing. With the intensity modulation of the excitation light, fluorescence lifetime can be measured in the frequency-domain at the fundamental modulation frequency (𝜔) and its harmonics (𝑛𝜔). Conventionally, the lifetime is measured at 1𝜔 and 2𝜔. The DC\u00261𝜔 lifetime measurement method that we proposed shows superior imaging sensitivity which doubles the imaging speed. Finally, we propose a super-resolution imaging technique by saturated excitation. When the excitation intensity is modulated and strong enough to partly drive the fluorophores into saturation, harmonic distortion in the fluorescence will be generated. Since the molecules in the focal center will undergo harmonic distortions earlier and heavier than the periphery, the demodulated signal from higher harmonics can be attributed solely to the center, acting as a point spread function (PSF) with improved resolution. By driving the fluorophore into saturation and demodulating the harmonic distorted fluorescence signal, we obtain DC and many harmonics. As the average excitation intensity changes, the harmonics variate in an interesting way: some harmonics (DC and 1𝜔) go smoothly, while others (2-4𝜔) encounter zeros at some specific excitation irradiances. Due to the extremely high nonlinearities around and at the zeros, super-resolution capability can be obtained.","tags":["MPM","FLIM","SNR","Super-resolution"],"title":"Super-sensitivity and super-resolution multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy","type":"unused"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"6f0db029ef23d5ee1920d376d8effec5","permalink":"https://yzhang34.github.io/project/saturation-compensated-flim/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/saturation-compensated-flim/","section":"project","summary":"Saturation-compensated measurements for fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy","tags":["Github Repository"],"title":"Saturation-compensated FLIM","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yide Zhang","Genevieve D.

We also analytically show that the MPM-FD-FLIM can exploit the DC and higher harmonic components generated by nonlinear optical mixing of the excitation light to improve SNR, reducing the required number of photons by an additional 50%.

In the case of two-photon excitation fluorescence, two lower-energy photons excite a fluorophore which in turn emits a single higher-energy photon, whose rate depends quadratically on the excitation intensity, thus enabling higher resolution with narrower point spread function (PSF) than conventional one-photon fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is also a powerful tool in biological, chemical, and medical studies by providing an additional contrast, the fluorescence decay lifetime of excited fluorophores, in optical microscopy. Since the fluorescence lifetime can be employed as the indicator of local ion or dissolved oxygen concentration, FLIM is a powerful tool to measure the microenvironment in biology. The MPM and FLIM techniques can be combined into an integrated imaging system for three-dimensional quantitative in vivo imaging. It not only possesses the advantages of MPM such as large imaging depth, but also the strengths of FLIM including the ability to discriminate different fluorophores with similar emission spectra. In this study, we propose a novel frequency domain MPM-FLIM platform, where the excitation light’s amplitude is modulated by an electro-optic modulator (EOM), and its intensity is controlled such that the fluorophore is driven to saturation. With the amplitude modulation, fluorescence lifetime can be measured in the frequency-domain at the fundamental modulation frequency and its harmonics. By driving the fluorophore into saturation and demodulating the higher harmonics from the saturated fluorescence light signal, imaging resolution beyond the diffraction limit can be obtained. Although the higher harmonics of the fluorescence signal have improved imaging resolution, their intensities are generally weaker than the fundamental harmonic signal; therefore it is important to consider the signal-to-noise ratio of this method during the experiment. The trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio and imaging resolution, especially for higher harmonic signals, is also discussed. Possible applications of the proposed high-resolution frequency-domain MPM-FLIM include imaging the concentration of oxygen and calcium ions at sub-cellular level, which could be beneficial to cancer research.","tags":["MPM","FLIM","Super-resolution"],"title":"High-resolution frequency-domain multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy","type":"unused"},{"authors":["Yide Zhang","Scott S.

It not only possesses the advantages of MPM such as large imaging depth, but also the strengths of FLIM including the ability to discriminate different fluorophores with similar emission spectra. In FLIM, the frequency-domain (FD) method, which relies on periodic intensity-modulated excitation light and its response to obtain lifetimes, is most commonly used for living animal imaging. The imaging rate of a FD-MPM-FLIM imaging system, however, is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the lifetime measurement. In this study, we show that the DC and higher harmonic components generated by nonlinear optical mixing of the excitation light can be exploited to improve the SNR of FD-FLIM, reducing the required number of photons, thus increasing the imaging rate, by 50%. Another approach called frequency-multiplexed MPM-PLIM can drastically increase the imaging rate by modulating the excitation light at a number of different fundamental frequencies, instead of a single one. The imaging rate, therefore, can be increased by up to a factor of 100. The modulation frequencies, however, should be within a single octave to avoid crosstalk between the fundamental and second-harmonic terms, which puts a limit to further increasing the imaging rate. In this study, we propose that by changing the excitation light’s waveform from sinusoid to square-root of sinusoid, the crosstalk between the fundamental and second-harmonic signals can be neutralized. Thus the limit on the frequency-multiplexing can be alleviated to further increase the imaging rate. Overall, the imaging rate of FD-MPM-FLIM can be 4 times as fast as that of conventional one-photon FD-FLIM by exploiting DC and harmonics components, and the rate can be increased by more than a 100 times using the improved frequency-multiplexing technique.","tags":["MPM","FLIM","SNR"],"title":"On increasing the imaging rate of frequency-domain multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy","type":"unused"},{"authors":["Shiping Wen","Zhigang Zeng","Tingwen Huang","Yide Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\r\r\r--\r\rClick the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.\r\r\r--\r","date":1417392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417392000,"objectID":"619b17eea1cff364db95ebde3b66fff9","permalink":"https://yzhang34.github.io/publication/j1-2014-tfs/","publishdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/j1-2014-tfs/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper investigates the problem of exponential lag synchronization control of memristive neural networks (MNNs) via the fuzzy method and applications in pseudorandom number generators.

Two examples about synchronization problems are presented to show the effectiveness of the obtained results, and an application of the obtained theory is also given in the pseudorandom number generator.","tags":["Memristor","Neural networks"],"title":"Exponential adaptive lag synchronization of memristive neural networks via fuzzy method and applications in pseudo random number generators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yide Zhang","Zhigang Zeng","Shiping Wen"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\r\r\r\rClick the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.\r\r\rSupplementary notes can be added here, including [code and math](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/). --\r","date":1404172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404172800,"objectID":"93bd99897665a29be130b8f30fcb6053","permalink":"https://yzhang34.github.io/unused/unused-publication/c1-2014-ijcnn/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/unused/unused-publication/c1-2014-ijcnn/","section":"unused","summary":"The property of changing resistance according to applied currents of memristors makes them candidates for emulating synapses in artificial neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a memristive synapse design into neural network circuits. Combined with modified integrate-and-fire (I\u0026F) complementary metal-oxide-semiconducter (CMOS) neurons, the memristive neural network shows similarities to its biological counterpart, in respect of biologically realistic, current-controlled spikes and adaptive synaptic plasticity. Then, the spike-rate-dependent plasticity (SRDP) of the synapse, an extended protocol of the Hebbian learning rule, is originally implemented by the circuit. And some advanced neural activities including learning, associative memory and forgetting are realized based on the SRDP rule. These activities are comprehensively validated on a neural network circuit inspired by famous Pavlov's dog-experiment with simulations and quantitative analyses.","tags":["Memristor","Neural networks"],"title":"Implementation of memristive neural networks with spike-rate-dependent plasticity synapse","type":"unused"}]
